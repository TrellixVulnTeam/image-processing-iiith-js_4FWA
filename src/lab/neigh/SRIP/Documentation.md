## Introduction: -
-----------------

This experiment is to study various types of image filter techniques used in
image processing. In this experiment, 2 types of filters are used with subtypes
of each:

1.  Linear Filters:

    * Straight Averaging

    *  Triangular

    *  Gaussian

2.  Non-Linear Filters:

    *  Median

    *  Unsharp

These filters can be used on the given images with selection of 3 different
window sizes (3x3, 5x5, 7x7), and the result of the filtering can be studied.

## Procedure: -
--------------

1.  Click on the image to be processed on from the mosaic of images on the top left side of the screen.


2.  The selected image will appear in the **Input Image** section.

3.  Now select one of the filters by clicking on the radio button in front of
    its name. Also select a required window size by clicking its respective
    radio button.

4.  Click on the **Run** button to apply the filter. The output image will
    appear on the **Output Image** section and the filter description will
    appear on the bottom, to the right of the smaller mosaic.

5.  Click on the **Reset** button to restore to the default condition of the
