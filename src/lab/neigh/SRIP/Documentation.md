## Introduction: -
-----------------

This experiment is to study various types of image filter techniques used in
image processing. In this experiment, 2 types of filters are used with subtypes
of each:

1.  Linear Filters:

    * Straight Averaging

    *  Triangular

    *  Gaussian

2.  Non-Linear Filters:

    *  Median

    *  Unsharp

These filters can be used on the given images with selection of 3 different
window sizes (3x3, 5x5, 7x7), and the result of the filtering can be studied.

## Procedure: -
--------------

1.  Click on the **Select Image** button on the top right side of the screen.

2.  An enlarge mosaic of images having 9 different images will appear on the
    screen. Click on one any of the image to select it.

3.  The selected image will appear in the **Input Image** section.

4.  Now select one of the filters by clicking on the radio button in front of
    its name. Also select a required window size by clicking its respective
    radio button.

5.  Click on the **Run** button to apply the filter. The output image will
    appear on the **Output Image** section and the filter description will
    appear on the bottom, to the right of the smaller mosaic.

6.  Click on the **Reset** button to restore to the default condition of the
    experiment.

7.  Alternatively, click on the small version of the mosaic at the bottom. This
    will open the enlarged mosaic as well.
